pinhole camera
ccd

steps in a camera:
   sample pixel
   generate rays
   fire rays
   pixel post processing
       e.g. spectrum -> channel sensitivity -> further processing
   frame processing
       e.g smear simulation

The pipeline needs to be programmable, build a set of observer objects that
define the basic workflow, for the user to implement as desired.
