Raysect Python Raytracing Package
=================================

A raytracing framework for optical/non-optical physics simulations.

This code is currently alpha quality and subject to significant change.

The setup.py will not currently install a working module (it's coming soon!). If you would like to experiment with the code you can use our development scripts. Raysect is wirtten in Cython, so you will need Cython installed. To setup the dev version, clone the repository and run the dev/build.sh script while in the raysect root directory. This will build the package in-place. The package can then be added to your python path and used.

Please note that raysect is currently only supported on Linux. We do not support Windows at present (in time!).
